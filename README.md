# University project - Assembly languages classes

For my university project in Assembly languages classes, I was required to write an application with a graphical user interface (GUI), for instance, in Windows forms. The crucial algorithm was supposed to be implemented in a high-level library and an assembly x64 library.

The project that I have uploaded includes only the source code with comments in Polish.
